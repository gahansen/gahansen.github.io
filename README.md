This is this github repo for my personal website hosted at
https://gahansen.github.io.

This site was built based on the [GitHub Pages Jeykyll Minima
theme](https://jekyll.github.io/minima/).  In fact, this git repos is a direct
fork of that GitHub repo and maintains all of the history of that repo.
Having this repo be a fork might make it easier to update this theme in the
future if there are changes to the theme with updated version of Ruby, Jekyll,
GitHub Pages, etc.

To develop on this site, you need to have Ruby and jeykll installed locally
and to locally inspect changes, you need to run:

```
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

inside of base git repo dir and then the site can be viewed in your local
browser at `http:/localhost:4000`.
