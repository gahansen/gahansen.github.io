This movie shows a FLEXI calculation of the 
[Liska-Wendroff implosion problem](https://lnkd.in/ejRm2Mq). 

[FLEXI](https://www.flexi-project.org) is a high performance open source
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code.

In this benchmark simulation, a shock wave originates in the lower left hand
corner, and bounces around inside the domain, reflecting off the walls. Jets
are produced as a result of these reflections. These jets collide at the
origin, forming a narrow jet that "squirts out" along the y=x axis. The
reflecting shock waves continually interact with this jet of dense gas over
time as the calculation proceeds.
