Glen is the VP of Development at STRA LLC.

Glen has focused his career on leading the development of multiphysics analysis
codes and algorithms. He led the Computational Multiphysics Department at
Sandia National Laboratories from 2014-2020, which is the home of the ALEGRA,
LGR, and FLEXO codes. He was a leader and technical contributor to the Albany
finite element code, and helped develop new ALE hydrodynamics capabilities in
ALEGRA as well as the GPU-based Lagrangian Grid Reconnection (LGR) code at
Sandia. He has also focused on fielding scientific GPU-based products, leading
both the development of Mini-Contact as well as the Flux Limited EXtended
Ohms-law (FLEXO) pulse power analysis codes. Prior to Sandia, Glen led the
Multiphysics Methods Group at the Idaho National Laboratory in developing
computational nuclear engineering tools, and was PI of the ASCI meshing effort
at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). At LANL, he served as Deputy Group
Leader of the Computational Science Methods Group in X-Division. He holds a
Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Idaho, an M.S. in Mechanical
Engineering from the University of Nebraska, a B.S. in Petroleum Engineering
from the University of Wyoming, and an A.A.S. in Petroleum Engineering
Technology from Casper College.
